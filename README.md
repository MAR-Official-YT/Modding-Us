### The Jester Role - Stirring Up Mischief!

Introducing the Jester role, a mischievous character whose sole aim is to be voted out by the crew! The Jester's objective is to sow chaos and confusion, leading the crew to mistakenly eject them from the submarine. Play as the Jester and show off your trickster skills, but be careful not to reveal your true intentions too soon!
