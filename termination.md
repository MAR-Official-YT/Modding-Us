I will not let you guys without anything, so i will only shutdown Modding Us when i finish the Dobby version
Or if innersloth asks... anyways the versions that are a clone of Among Us (the ones in this repo) will not be supported or updated anymore.

It was not shutdowned completely, just closed to beta testers.
It was also not by request of anyone, its just because i wanna make a mod
That follows Among Us Guidelines. So Modding Us will be kind of rewritten
as a legal mod, for newer versions, using Dobby.

When i finish the first beta for newer versions using Dobby injection, it will be back again.
