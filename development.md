# Development Warning!
The devs of the mod are updating the game and the game will be unavailable because the update will come soon.
When the update come out it will be available again.

# How is development going:
I'm putting in a lot of effort to convert Modding Us to a pure script using DobbyHook. The current method goes against Innersloth Guidelines because Modding Us is essentially a decompiled version of the game, and sharing the APK counts as redistribution. That's why I'm working on turning it into a launcher that hooks into the original game instead of being a separate game.
