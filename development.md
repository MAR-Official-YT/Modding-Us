# Development Warning!
The developers of the mod are currently working on an update for the game. During this period, the game will be temporarily unavailable. Once the update is complete, the game will be made available again for players to enjoy the new features and improvements.

# How is development going:
I'm putting in a lot of effort to convert Modding Us to a pure script using DobbyHook. The current method goes against Innersloth Guidelines because Modding Us is essentially a decompiled version of the game, and sharing the APK counts as redistribution. That's why I'm working on turning it into a launcher that hooks into the original game instead of being a separate game.
